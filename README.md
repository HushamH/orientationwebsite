# University College Orientation Website

## Overview
This is the website that is going to be the home of all things related to Orientation Week 2015 at University College, University of Toronto. The aim of this website is to captivate and inform the class of 2019 on the opportunities available to them throughout Orientation Week. Once they are convinced, they can register and purchase their tickets all on the website. From an administrative point of view, the website provides a backend portal, powered by the django-admin, that allows the executive team to manage and automate a majority of the functions necessary to organize orientation. 

## Build
* The front-end was built using HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap 3, Javascript & jQuery. 
* The back-end was built using Django (extended with django-allauth and crispy forms), PostgresSQL, and Stripe.
* The graphics were created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.

## Functionality
* A user can view every page anonymously, sign up for an account, log into their account, purchase an Orientation ticket, view their confirmation number and sign out.
* A staff member, or an administrator can do everything a user can, but additionally has access to the backend. The backend stores all of the registrants. Via the backend, an admin can modify registrant information, view payment information, serach, filter and group registrants, as well many other constantly updated custom functions to help simplify the planning of orientation throughout its different stages. 

## Current development stage / Recent Updates

Currently the website is live at www.ucorientation.com. Registration is currently up and running and the backend is fully functional. Recent updates have been minor bug fixes.
